## About

Differentiation Engine uses symbolic differentiation to compute derivatives and graphs for functions programmatically. It does not do any numeric approximation until the graphing stage, using only syntax tree rewrites and reductions to produce the derivative formula. It supports differentiation of both single-variable and multivariate functions.
